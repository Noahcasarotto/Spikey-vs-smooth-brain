# Spiky vs Spherical: A Lean 4 Formalization

This project formalizes the classical mathematical theorem that **under convex returns, being "spiky" (excellent at 1-2 things) beats being "spherical" (well-rounded)**.

## The Main Result

**Theorem**: Given convex payoffs and a fixed resource budget, concentration (being spiky) dominates diversification (being spherical).

This principle has been proven independently across multiple fields:
- **Mathematics**: Jensen's Inequality (1906), Karamata's Inequality (1932), Schur-Convexity (Hardy-Littlewood-Pólya, 1934)
- **Economics**: Specialization (Adam Smith, 1776), Returns to Scale (Marshall, Young, Krugman), Superstar Economics (Rosen, 1981)
- **Modern Applications**: Venture Capital, Career Strategy, Innovation Economics

## Historical Context

### Mathematical Foundations

1. **Jensen's Inequality (1906)**: For convex f,
   ```
   f((x₁ + ... + xₙ)/n) ≤ (f(x₁) + ... + f(xₙ))/n
   ```
   Concentration beats averaging for convex functions.

2. **Karamata's Inequality (1932)**: If x majorizes y (x is "spikier") and f is convex,
   ```
   Σf(xᵢ) ≥ Σf(yᵢ)
   ```
   More unequal distributions yield higher totals under convex payoffs.

3. **Schur-Convexity (Hardy-Littlewood-Pólya, 1934)**: Convex symmetric functions increase with inequality.

### Economic Applications

1. **Adam Smith (1776)**: *The Wealth of Nations*
   - Specialization in a single craft boosts productivity through learning-by-doing and economies of scale
   - The pin factory example: spiky allocation of labor beats generalist workers

2. **Alfred Marshall (1890s)**: Increasing Returns
   - If returns are convex, concentrating resources in one industry/city is optimal
   - Led to theory of industrial districts and clusters

3. **Allyn Young (1928)**: Economic Growth Through Specialization
   - Growth comes from specialization and "roundabout production"
   - Spiky allocation fuels compounding growth

4. **Paul Krugman (1980s-90s)**: New Trade Theory
   - Used increasing returns to explain why countries specialize in few industries
   - Nobel Prize work based on convex returns → concentration principle

5. **Sherwin Rosen (1981)**: Economics of Superstars
   - In markets with convex returns (e.g., one artist reaching millions via tech), being the best yields disproportionate rewards
   - One great violinist/programmer/athlete worth more than many average ones

6. **Gordon Tullock (1960s-80s)**: Contest Theory
   - With convex payoffs, better to concentrate resources in one battle than spread thinly
   - Applications: lobbying, R&D races, advertising

### Modern Applications

1. **Venture Capital**: 
   - VC returns follow power laws (extreme convexity)
   - Better to fund "spiky" founders with extraordinary strength in 1-2 areas
   - 1 company returning 100× matters more than 30 returning 1.5×

2. **Startups & Entrepreneurship**:
   - Winner-take-most markets reward spiky strategies
   - Dominate one niche before spreading (beachhead strategy)

3. **Career Development**:
   - Labor markets reward world-class ability in 1-2 areas
   - Better to be excellent at something specific than mediocre at everything

4. **Innovation & R&D**:
   - Convex payoffs mean doubling down on promising directions beats spreading resources evenly

## The Core Principle

### When to Be Spiky (Convex Payoffs, RTP > 1)

✅ **Concentration is optimal when:**
- Returns are super-linear (f(x) = x², exponential)
- Winner-take-most markets
- Breakthrough-driven fields
- Superstar economics apply
- Network effects or compounding returns

**Examples**: VC investing, startup strategy, creative careers, innovation races

### When to Be Spherical (Concave Payoffs, RTP < 1)

❌ **Diversification is optimal when:**
- Returns are sub-linear (f(x) = √x, log(x))
- Diminishing marginal returns
- Weakest-link systems
- Complementary skills (multiplicative payoffs)
- Risk management matters

**Examples**: Portfolio diversification, insurance, robust systems, safety-critical engineering

### Neutral Case (Linear Payoffs, RTP = 1)

For linear f(x) = ax + b, spiky and spherical are equivalent.

## The Formalization

### Setup

Given:
- `d` skill dimensions with minimum bars `bᵢ`
- A fixed extra budget `S = Σᵢ (xᵢ - bᵢ)` to distribute above the bars
- A value function `V(x) = Σᵢ f(xᵢ)` where `f` is convex and increasing

### Main Theorems

1. **`convex_marginal_gains_monotone`**: The core inequality
   ```lean
   For convex f and a ≥ b: f(a + δ) - f(a) ≥ f(b + δ) - f(b)
   ```
   Marginal gains increase as the base value increases.

2. **`concentration_improves_value`**: Moving resources from y to x improves total value
   ```lean
   f(x + ε) + f(y - ε) ≥ f(x) + f(y)  when x ≥ y
   ```

3. **`spike_allocation_exists`**: There exists an optimal k-spiky allocation
   
4. **`spike_beats_uniform_d2`**: For d=2, extreme spike beats uniform spread

5. **`concave_favors_uniform`**: The reverse holds for concave functions

### Examples

**Venture Capital**: Power law payoff f(x) = x^α for α > 1 is convex
- Favors concentrated bets on spiky founders

**Career Strategy**: For k=2, be world-class at 1-2 things
- Clear minimum bars everywhere
- Concentrate all extra effort into 1-2 areas of excellence

## One-Liner Summary

**After you clear minimum bars, if payoffs are convex in your top skills (super-linear returns), then by Jensen/Karamata the optimal allocation is spiky: concentrate effort into 1-2 axes; keep the rest at the bar.**
