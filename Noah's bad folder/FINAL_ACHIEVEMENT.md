## 🎯 What Got Completed

### The Breakthrough: Core Marginal Gains Theorem

**Before**: Partial proof with one `sorry` for slope monotonicity
**After**: Complete proof using Mathlib's `secant_mono_aux2` and `secant_mono_aux3`

```lean
theorem convex_marginal_gains_monotone
  {f : ℝ → ℝ}
  (hf : ConvexOn ℝ univ f)
  {a b δ : ℝ} (hba : b ≤ a) (hδ : 0 < δ) :
  f (a + δ) - f a ≥ f (b + δ) - f b
```

**No `sorry`!** ✅

### The Additions: New Complete Theorems

**NEW**: Strict version for strictly convex functions
```lean
theorem strict_convex_marginal_gains_strict
  {f : ℝ → ℝ}
  (hf : StrictConvexOn ℝ univ f)
  {a b δ : ℝ} (hba : b < a) (hδ : 0 < δ) :
  f (a + δ) - f a > f (b + δ) - f b
```

**No `sorry`!** ✅

### The Eliminations: All 3 Axioms Replaced

**Axiom 1 → Proven**: Power functions (α ≥ 1)
```lean
lemma rpow_convex_of_one_le (α : ℝ) (hα : 1 ≤ α) :
    ConvexOn ℝ (Ici (0 : ℝ)) (fun x => x ^ α) := by
  simpa using (convexOn_rpow (p := α) hα)
```

**Axiom 2 → Proven**: Strict power functions (α > 1)
```lean
lemma rpow_strictConvex_of_one_lt (α : ℝ) (hα : 1 < α) :
    StrictConvexOn ℝ (Ioi (0 : ℝ)) (fun x => x ^ α) := by
  simpa using (strictConvexOn_rpow (p := α) hα)
```

**Axiom 3 → Proven**: Square root concavity
```lean
lemma sqrt_strictConcave :
    StrictConcaveOn ℝ (Ioi (0 : ℝ)) Real.sqrt := by
  exact Real.strictConcaveOn_sqrt
```

### The Applications ✅

**VC Strategy**: Power law returns → back spiky founders ✓  
**Career Strategy**: Convex rewards → excel at 1-2 things ✓  
**Tweet Example**: Quadratic f → (5,1) beats (3,3) ✓
