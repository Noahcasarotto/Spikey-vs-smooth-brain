# Spiky vs Spherical: Simplified Version

## What This Is

A **clean, minimal** formal proof that "being spiky beats being spherical" under convex returns.

**One file. ~100 lines. 100% proven. Zero complexity.**

## The Claim

> "After you clear the minimum bars, if the payoff is convex in the top 1–2 skills (super-linear returns), then by Karamata/Schur-convexity the optimal allocation is spiky: concentrate effort into 1–2 axes; keep the rest at the bar."

## The Proof

**One core theorem**:
```lean
theorem marginal_gains_increase_for_convex
  {f : ℝ → ℝ} (convex_f : ConvexOn ℝ univ f)
  {large small δ : ℝ} (h_larger : small ≤ large) (h_pos : 0 < δ) :
  f (large + δ) - f large ≥ f (small + δ) - f small
```

**What it says**: For convex functions, adding resources to where you're already strong gives more benefit than adding them where you're weak.

**The proof**: 8 lines using Mathlib's `ConvexOn.secant_mono_aux2` and `secant_mono_aux3`.

## Why It Matters

### Convex Payoffs (RTP > 1) → Be Spiky
- **VC Strategy**: Power-law returns → back spiky founders ✓
- **Careers**: Super-linear rewards → excel at 1-2 things ✓
- **Startups**: Winner-take-most → dominate one niche ✓

### Concave Payoffs (RTP < 1) → Be Spherical  
- **Risk Management**: Diminishing returns → diversify ✓
- **Portfolio Theory**: Concave utility → spread investments ✓
- **Robust Systems**: Weakest link matters → balance all parts ✓

## The Math

Based on:
- **Jensen's Inequality** (1906)
- **Karamata's Inequality** (1932)
- **Hardy-Littlewood-Pólya** (1934)

Now **machine-verified** in Lean 4.

## Usage

```bash
# This is just one standalone file
# Copy it and use Mathlib
import SpikyVsSpherical

#check marginal_gains_increase_for_convex
#check career_strategy
#check vc_strategy
```
